# Models (coming soon)

Model verbs will wrap machine learning and statistical estimators that accept cubes as inputs and emit new cubes or summaries. Planned functionality includes:

- Bias-corrected regression models linking climate drivers to vegetation outcomes.
- Spatiotemporal clustering for anomaly detection.
- Cube-aware storage/adapters (Zarr catalogs, parquet metadata) so trained models can rehydrate their inputs.

Follow the [Roadmap](../dev/roadmap.md) for updates and contribute ideas via issues or pull requests.
